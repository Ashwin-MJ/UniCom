# UniCom - The Student Feedback App

This project is being developed as part of the 3rd Year Team Project at the University of Glasgow.

## Project Details

### Why this project and who is it for?
The aim of the project is to develop an application that improves the student learning experience and create a new platform to give and receive feedback in the University of Glasgow Social and Public Policy undergraduate programme (SPP).

### What problem is it aiming to solve?
There is currently a lack of effective way for lecturers to communicate feedback to students regularly, particularly on their performance in seminars, tutorials, and small-group discussions. <br>
The client wishes to implement a new approach to give brief comments to students weekly and, in addition, offer for students to give comments to each other and to the lecturer through an app. <br>
Similar learning technology apps exist in the industry, however, appear to target to a younger audience, rather than in higher education. <br>
There is also limited flexibility for students to send customised feedback to each other or to the lecturer. This offers an opportunity to create a new app that would be suitable and flexible to the needs of lecturers and students in a university context.
