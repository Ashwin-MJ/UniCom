\begin{abstract}

As students, we feel that there is a lack of communication between lecturers and students in terms of our progress during various courses. This is an area that was also identified by the client, Dr Mark Wong of the school of Social and Public Policy, and in this project our team aimed to develop an application which attempts to minimise this gap in communication and improve a students learning experience at university.

The client requested that an application is developed which allows lecturers to provide their students with feedback in different areas as they proceed through a module. This was intended to provide positive reinforcement to the student, and motivate them to improve in areas brought to their attention by the lecturer.

This dissertation details the teams journey in developing this application beginning with requirements gathering, developing a specification, the development effort itself, and finally how the application was deployed. Furthermore, the ways in which the software engineering practices taught during the PSD course were applied to this project is also discussed. In particular, the use of Agile software development is detailed extensively, in addition to how members of the group worked together in this team project to deliver a product which met the requirements of Dr Mark Wong.
