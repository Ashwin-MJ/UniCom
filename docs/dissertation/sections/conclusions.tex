\textit{A conclusion that draws general and wider lessons from the case study (approximately 1-2 pages).}

Explain the wider lessons that you learned about software engineering,
based on the specific issues discussed in previous sections.  Reflect

types of software project.  Relate the wider lessons to others
reported in case studies in the software engineering literature.
