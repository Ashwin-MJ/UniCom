# UniCom Documentation

Version 1.0.0

See the main repository [README.md](http://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2018-ese1/dissertation/blob/master/README.md) file for more information about the project in general.

This documentation has been included to allow another developer to take over the project if required.

## Introduction

The UniCom application has been developed using the Django Framework to allow for fast iteration. The framework makes use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to provide a meaningful separation of concerns for various aspects of the development effort. It allows the data presentation to be separated from the actual logic of the application.

See [Model-View-Controller](general/Model-View-Controller.md) for more information about this pattern and how it has been applied in this project.

The documentation for this project has been separated into two sections:

* [Project documentation](project/README.md)
* [General documentation](general/README.md)
