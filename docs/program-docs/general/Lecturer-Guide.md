This is the page you are presented with if you navigate to a given course.

At the top a "Course Token" is displayed - this is a unique code which is used to allow another student/lecturer to join this course. The functionality to send a token directly from the website is available if you click "Send Token".

On the left is a list of all students in the course. You may select multiple students to provide "group feedback" or one or more students to provide "individual feedback".

In the middle, a list of the feedback that has been recently given for this course, and on the right is a leaderboard which shows the top performing students in this course.

If you choose to give Individual Feedback to a student you are directed to this page.

Here you can select a category, after which a list of messages will be displayed corresponding to that category. Select a message, enter an optional message if you wish, and provide a score from 0-5.

Click submit feedback to give that feedback to this student.

On the right you will see that students total score (across all courses) as well as recent feedback they have received. This allows you to view what other lecturers/students are giving to that student and determine what you wish to tell them accordingly.

You can click on a student's profile picture to view their profile page.

Note that on "Courses" page, if you selected more than one student and gave Individual Feedback, then upon clicking submit feedback the page will be reloaded for the next student in the list. When all students have been given feedback you are redirected to a page which shows all feedback you have given.

### Group Feedback
