# Student Guide

## Home Page

If you sign-up/login as a Student the first page you will see is the home page:

Here you can view the recent feedback you have received on the left.

On the right is an attribute graph which displays your progress in different attributes over time. The graph automatically resizes. You can click on a category at the bottom to remove/add it from the graph.

At the bottom there is an "Achievements" section. This is intended to motivate the student by showing them what they are doing well in, and which areas they are yet to receive an achievement for.

## Courses

On the left you can view the courses you are currently enrolled in. You can click on one of these courses to find more information about it.

On the right you have the option of joining a new course. A lecturer may have emailed you a "Course Token" - simply copy that token and paste it in this box and click "Join Course". You will then be enrolled in this course, and can begin to receive feedback for that course.

## Course

Here you can view information about a selected course. On the left you can see which lecturers are in charge of this course, a description, and your current score in this course.

The recent feedback you have received in this course is displayed in the middle.

And on the right is a leaderboard which is intended to motivate students to perform better.

A student is also able to give feedback by clicking on another student in the leaderboard. This works in the same way as providing individual feedback as a lecturer (see [Lecturer Guide](docs/program-docs/general/Lecturer-Guide.md))

By clicking on another students profile picture, you can view that students profile. This displays:

Note that as a student, you can only see the feedback you have given this student. This is to ensure that feedback given by lecturers and other students remain private.

## Feedback

This page allows a student to view their own progress.

On the left is a panel which displays all the recent feedback they have received across all courses.

"My Top Attributes" shows the student which attributes they are performing best in, and similarly "Areas to Improve" displays attributes in which they are not performing as well.

The student can view these stats and identify what they need to work on accordingly.

At the bottom is a button which allows a student to view the feedback they have given to other students. This redirects to the following page:

Here a student can delete a feedback they have given if they want to, and they can also sort feedback.
