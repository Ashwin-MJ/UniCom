If you sign-up/login as a Student the first page you will see is the home page:

Here you can view the recent feedback you have received on the left.

On the right is an attribute graph which displays your progress in different attributes over time. The graph automatically resizes. You can click on a category at the bottom to remove/add it from the graph.

At the bottom there is an "Achievements" section. This is intended to motivate the student by showing them what they are doing well in, and which areas they are yet to receive an achievement for.
