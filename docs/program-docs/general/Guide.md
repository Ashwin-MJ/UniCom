See [README.md](http://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2018-ese1/dissertation/blob/master/README.md) for an overview of the intended use of the application.

The application allows a lecturer to provide students in their course with feedback to suggest areas of improvement or to acknowledge impressive performance.

A user also has the option of deleting a message or a category. Note that if one of these are deleted, then ALL feedbacks given with that message/category will also be deleted. For this reason, a warning is included:
