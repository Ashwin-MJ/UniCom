# Application Guide

This includes an overview of how to actually use the application

## General

See [README.md](http://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2018-ese1/dissertation/blob/master/README.md) for an overview of the intended use of the application.

The application allows a lecturer to provide students in their course with feedback to suggest areas of improvement or to acknowledge impressive performance.

If you sign-up/login as a Lecturer the first page you will see is the home page:

Here you can view the different courses you are part of, and recent feedback you have given to different students. You can either directly click on a course to view more information about it, or click "Courses" in the navbar to be directed to another page:

Here you can again click on one of the courses to find out more information about it (see below). You are also presented with a card which shows which of your students (across all courses) has the highest scores. Additionally you have the option of joining an existing course using the "Join a Course" panel on the left using a course token (explained below).

Also note that you have the option of creating a new course. To do this simply click the required button and include the relevant information.

This is the page you are presented with if you navigate to a given course.

At the top a "Course Token" is displayed - this is a unique code which is used to allow another student/lecturer to join this course. The functionality to send a token directly from the website is available if you click "Send Token".

On the left is a list of all students in the course. You may select multiple students to provide "group feedback" or one or more students to provide "individual feedback".

In the middle, a list of the feedback that has been recently given for this course, and on the right is a leaderboard which shows the top performing students in this course.


### Giving Feedback

#### Individual

If you choose to give Individual Feedback to a student you are directed to this page.

Here you can select a category, after which a list of messages will be displayed corresponding to that category. Select a message, enter an optional message if you wish, and provide a score from 0-5.

Click submit feedback to give that feedback to this student.

On the right you will see that students total score (across all courses) as well as recent feedback they have received. This allows you to view what other lecturers/students are giving to that student and determine what you wish to tell them accordingly.

Note that on "Courses" page, if you selected more than one student and gave Individual Feedback, then upon clicking submit feedback the page will be reloaded for the next student in the list. When all students have been given feedback you are redirected to a page which shows all feedback you have given.

#### Group Feedback

The process for giving Group Feedback is similar to that mentioned above. Note that on the right you can view the stats for the different students you selected.

Upon clicking "Submit Feedback", the same feedback is given to all selected students.


### All Feedback

This page simply shows all the feedback you have given. Here you have the additional option of deleting a feedback, as well as the standard sorting options.
